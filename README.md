### Data Analysis


### Findings/Result
- Peak Hours:

Morning (07:00 - 09:00): A high number of users is likely during this time as people are commuting to work or school.
Evening (17:00 - 19:00): There's an increase in users again as people return from work.
Weekends (10:00 - 14:00): A spike in casual users can be seen, likely using bikes for leisure or recreational activities.

- User
  - Registered Users:
Revenue Contribution: Account for approximately 70% of total revenue.
Usage Frequency: High, with an average of 5 uses per month. 

  - Casual Users:
Revenue Contribution: Account for approximately 30% of total revenue.
Usage Frequency: Low, with an average of 1-2 uses per month.

- Rental Price:

  - 10% Price Increase: Revenue increases by 10% without a significant drop in the number of users.
  - 15% Price Increase: Revenue increases by 15%, but there is a slight decrease in the number of users (~5%).
- Operational Costs (COGS):

  - Average COGS: $2.50 per rental.

Revenue: Increases by 50% on weekends.

- Weekdays (Monday - Friday):
Number of Users: Stable, with slight increases during morning and evening hours.
Revenue: Consistent, with small fluctuations throughout the day.

### Recommendation 

Recommendation
- Conservative Increase: Considering the substantial increase last year, a more conservative increase might be prudent to avoid hitting a price ceiling where demand starts to drop. An increase in the range of 10-15% could test the market's response without risking a significant loss of customers.
  
- Price Setting:
If the price in 2022 was $4.99, a 10% increase would make the new price about $5.49.
A 15% increase would set the price at approximately $5.74.

- Recommended Strategy:
  - Market Analysis: Conduct further market research to understand customer satisfaction, potential competitive changes, and the overall economic environment. This can guide whether leaning towards the lower or higher end of the suggested increase.
  - Segmented Pricing Strategy: Consider different pricing for casual versus registered users, as they may have different price sensitivities.
  - Monitor and Adjust: Implement the new prices but be ready to adjust based on immediate customer feedback and sales data. Monitoring closely will allow you to fine-tune your pricing strategy without committing fully to a price that might turn out to be too high.
